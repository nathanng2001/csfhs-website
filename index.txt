Welcome to the Computer Science Pathway at Franklin High School. My name is Mr. Dagler, and I am the teacher for this pathway. At this website, you will find a description for all of the classes I teach and how I connect my students to industry partners: guest speakers, field trips, coding camps, and computations. 



There are two options for this pathway: a programming one and a web-development one. The programming pathway requires you to take exploring computer science, AP computer science A and AP computer science principles in order. Where, the web-development pathway requres you to take exploring computer science, web-development 1 and web-development 2 in order.  You will earn _________ if you take one additional computer science course in either pathway and receive a graduation cord. If you are interested in my classes or have any other questions, please contact me at mrdagler@csfhs.net.
